<h1>Data source</h1>
Data was downloaded from the link below. The repository covered Chicago's Divvy bike-sharing service trip records since January 2013 until today (download date - 15 October 2023). For the purpose of our analysis, full data on 2022 trips were selected as a representative period (to account for seasonal fluctuations).<br>

<h1>Data upload</h1>
Initial data validation was conducted in Google Big Query. In order to upload the data to Big Query workspace, the following steps were completed:
  <li>Data was downloaded in 12 separate CSV files with monthly records</li>
  <li>For ease of batch upload to Big Query, a dedicated bucket was created in Google Cloud Storage service where all the monthly files were uploaded</li>
  <li>Monthly CSV files from the bucket were loaded to Big Query to create a single table with full 2022 data</li>
  <li>It was identified that the CSV file with September 2022 data was omitted in the initial upload due to a different naming convention. To remediate this, the September 2022 file was uploaded into a separate table in Big Query workspace and inserted into the comprehensive 2022 table using the query below</li>
<br>

```sql
  INSERT INTO `trips_2022.trips_2022`
  SELECT *
  FROM `trips_2022.trips_202209`
```
<br>
<h1>Initial data validation</h1>
Checks were conducted over the uploaded dataset to identify possible data quality issues and confirm data reliability.
The following aspects were validated:
  <li>Duplicate ride IDs - query as per below. No duplicates were identified - number of unique ride IDs was equal to the total number of records</li>
<br>

```sql
  SELECT COUNT(ride_id) AS all_ride_ids, COUNT (DISTINCT ride_id) AS unique_ride_ids
  FROM `trips_2022.trips_2022`
```
<br>

|Row|all_ride_ids|unique_ride_ids|
|---|------------:|---------------:|
|1|5667717|5667717|

<br
  <li>Min. and max. values of bike rental start and end dates were identified - query as per below. Values in line with expectations, e.g. minimum dates 2022-</li>
  <br>

```sql
  SELECT CAST(MIN(started_at) AS date) AS min_started_at, CAST(MAX(started_at) AS date) AS max_started_at, CAST(MIN(ended_at) AS date) AS min_ended_at, CAST(MAX(ended_at) AS date) AS max_ended_at
FROM `trips_2022.trips_2022`
```
