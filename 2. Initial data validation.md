<h1>Data source</h1>
Data was downloaded from the link below. The repository covered Chicago's Divvy bike-sharing service trip records since January 2013 until today (download date - 15 October 2023). For the purpose of our analysis, full data on 2022 trips were selected as a representative period (to account for seasonal fluctuations).<br>

<h2>Data upload</h2>
Initial data validation was conducted in Google Big Query. In order to upload the data to Big Query workspace, the following steps were completed:
<ul>
  <li>Data was downloaded in 12 separate CSV files with monthly records</li>
  <li>For ease of batch upload to Big Query, a dedicated bucket was created in Google Cloud Storage service where all the monthly files were uploaded</li>
  <li>Monthly CSV files from the bucket were loaded to Big Query to create a comprehensive 2022 dataset</li>
  <li>It was identified that the CSV file with September 2022 data was omitted in the upload due to a different naming convention. To remediate this, the September 2022 file was uploaded into a separate table in Big Query workspace and inserted into the table with the comprehensive 2022 dataset using the query below</li>
>INSERT INTO `trips_2022.trips_2022`
SELECT *
FROM `trips_2022.trips_202209`
