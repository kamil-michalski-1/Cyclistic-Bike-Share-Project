<h1>Data source</h1>
Data was downloaded from the link below. The repository covered Chicago's Divvy bike-sharing service trip records since January 2013 until today (download date - 15 October 2023). For the purpose of our analysis, full data on 2022 trips were selected as a representative period (to account for seasonal fluctuations).<br>

<h1>Data upload</h1>
Initial data validation was conducted in Google Big Query. In order to upload the data to Big Query workspace, the following steps were completed:
  <li>Data was downloaded in 12 separate CSV files with monthly records</li>
  <li>For ease of batch upload to Big Query, a dedicated bucket was created in Google Cloud Storage service where all the monthly files were uploaded</li>
  <li>Monthly CSV files from the bucket were loaded to Big Query to create a single table with full 2022 data</li>
  <li>It was identified that the CSV file with September 2022 data was omitted in the initial upload due to a different naming convention. To remediate this, the September 2022 file was uploaded into a separate table in Big Query workspace and inserted into the comprehensive 2022 table using the query below</li>
<br>

```sql
  INSERT INTO `trips_2022.trips_2022`
  SELECT *
  FROM `trips_2022.trips_202209`
```
<br>
<h1>Initial data validation</h1>
Checks were conducted over the uploaded dataset to identify possible data quality issues and confirm data reliability.
The following aspects were validated:
  <li>Duplicate ride IDs - query as per below. No duplicates were identified - number of unique ride IDs was equal to the total number of records</li>
<br>

```sql
  SELECT COUNT(ride_id) AS all_ride_ids, COUNT (DISTINCT ride_id) AS unique_ride_ids
  FROM `trips_2022.trips_2022`
```
<br>

|Row|all_ride_ids|unique_ride_ids|
|:-:|:----------:|:--------------:|
|1  |5667717     |5667717         |

<br>
  <li>Min. and max. values of bike rental start and end dates were identified - query as per below. Values were in line with expectations, e.g. minimum start and end dates 1 January 2022, maximum start date 31 December 2022, maximum end day 2 January 2023 (this was considered correct due to the possible occurrence of extended rentals commenced on 31 December and not closed until after New Year's Day - these trips were kept in the dataset).</li>
  <br>

```sql
  SELECT CAST(MIN(started_at) AS date) AS min_started_at,
  CAST(MAX(started_at) AS date) AS max_started_at,
  CAST(MIN(ended_at) AS date) AS min_ended_at,
  CAST(MAX(ended_at) AS date) AS max_ended_at
  FROM `trips_2022.trips_2022`
```

<br>

|Row|min_started_at|max_started_at|min_ended_at|max_ended_at|
|---|:------------:|:------------:|:----------:|:----------:|
|1	|2022-01-01    |2022-12-31    |  2022-01-01|2023-01-02  |

<br>
<li>Numbers of rides in particular months were obtained - query as per below. This helped assure that the source datasets included complete data covering all the months in 2022 and that the variability between months remains within a reasonable range that can be explained with seasonal trends.</li>

```sql
  SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM started_at) AS started_at_month,
  COUNT(*) AS number_of_rides
  FROM `trips_2022.trips_2022`
  GROUP BY started_at_month
  ORDER BY started_at_month
```

<br>

|Row|started_at_month|number_of_rides|
|---|:--------------:|:-------------:|
|1	|1               |103770         |
