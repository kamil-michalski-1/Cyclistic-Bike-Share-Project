<h1>Data Analysis Capstone Project - Cyclistic Bike-Share</h1>

<h2>Intro</h2>
Hi, my name is Kamil Michalski. I'm passionate about data and believe that it can change the world for better, giving us deeper understanding of issues we face in business and in life, and guiding us towards more effective solutions. I'm very keen to further expand my knowledge and skills in the field of data.<br>
<br></be>This location documents my work on a capstone project at the end of my journey with Google Data Analyst Certificate. The project is a case study provided in the programme and concerns a data analysis for a bike-share company Cyclistic. While Cyclistic is a fictional company, the analysis is based on a real dataset made available to the public by Lyft Bikes and Scooters, LLC operating Chicago’s Divvy bike-sharing service.<br>
<br>I hope the attached files clearly present the scope of work done and demonstrate my skills & approach. If you have any questions or comments, you can reach me via email on <a href="mailto:kammich4@gmail.com">kammich4@gmail.com</a>. You can also see further details about me incl. experience, skills, and career history in my profile on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/k-michalski). <br>
<br>Thanks!
