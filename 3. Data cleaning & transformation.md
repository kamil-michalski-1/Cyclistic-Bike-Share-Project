<h1>Data cleaning & transformation</h1>
Further procedures were conducted to confirm the integrity of data and better understand its structure and potential limitations. The aspects reviewed included:
<li>Check what rideable types are visible in the dataset and confirm that all trips had a meaningful rideable type indicated. Three rideable types were noted with no incorrect or unexpected values in the dataset.</li>

```sql
SELECT rideable_type, COUNT(ride_id) AS trips_per_rideable_type
FROM `trips_2022.trips_2022`
GROUP BY rideable_type
```
|Row|rideable_type|trips_per_rideable_type|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|1|classic_bike|2601214|
|2|docked_bike|177474|
|3|electric_bike|2889029|
